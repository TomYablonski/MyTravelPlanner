## My Travel Planner

Capstone Webpack App to build out a travel app that gets a desired trip location & date from the user, and displays weather and an image of the location.
This application uses data retrived from the following API websites : http://www.geonames.org/export/web-services.html, https://www.weatherbit.io/, and https://pixabay.com/api/

This app was enhanced to allow the user to display up to three pictures of their destination if there are three picturs available to display.
